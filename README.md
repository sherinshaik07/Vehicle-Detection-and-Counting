# Vehicle Detection and Counting using YOLOv8

This project aims to detect and count vehicles from road traffic videos using Object Detection (YOLOv8 model).

# Week 1 Progress
- Selected Technology: Object Detection
- Theme: Automotive
- Goal: Build a system that detects vehicles and counts them.
- Imported YOLOv8 pre-trained model.

- ## Week 2 Progress
- Trained and tested YOLOv8 on sample traffic image.
- Used pretrained YOLOv8 model to detect vehicles.
- Tested on `bus.jpg` and got detection output (`detect.png`).
- Improved model accuracy using pretrained weights.
